![Active Biblio](activebiblio.JPG?raw=true)

Active Biblio aims to enhance book sharing amongst Amundi and partners employees.    
The goal here is to offer a new way of renting books interactively, sharing opinions and informations    

The project will mostly consist in a Web interface where each user will be able to rent, share, and comment books.   
A server and a database will display every book available and offer a new way of renting books, check if there are still some hardcopies left, and what users think about it.    
A CLI will be provided for the most adventurous who prefer to choose a book without being discouraged by its cover !
